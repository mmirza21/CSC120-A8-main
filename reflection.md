- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?'
It represents an adventurer which has different attributes like location and HP. The adventurer also has an inventory of items that it can use or examine and get hints from. I used the different methods to use items discovered as the adventurer performs different tasks that affects its HP, location and/or inventory.
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
This was definitely the most exciting assignment of all due to how much freedom it gave us to choose what we want to do, which is perfect for a final assignment. I;m glad that we started off with more guided assignments that helped us follow instruction and learn on to code, but began to learn how to figure stuff out on our own in later homeworks.
